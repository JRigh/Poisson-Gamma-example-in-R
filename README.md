## Poisson-Gamma-example-in-R
Example of Poisson-Gamma model in Bayesian analysis in R

We take an example of Poisson likelihood data (artificially generated) of size 20 and model the prior with a Gamma(2,2) distribution. We then sample from the posterior
Gamma(19,22) and compute posterior quantities using direct sampling.
